I have a project assigned to me by national council for culture arts and literature (NCCAL)

They have two type of services:

1. Preventive Maintenance
2. Service Maintenance

When an Inspector (Technician/Engineer/Someone) goes to a Customer, they can update a job card via a tablet assigned to them
Each time they visit a customer a new job card is to be created with the following details:

1. Unique Job Card number (preferably 9 digits) which increments each time anew job card is created
2.Date In indicating the time they reached to the customer's site
3. Customer Name (which customer the inspector visited)
4. Date Out indicating what time they finished work at the site
5. Total Hours indicating the total time they took (Date Out - Date In)
6. Type (Preventive Maintenance/Service Maintenance)
7. Inspector (The name of the Engineer who visited)
8. Remarks (optional)

9. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT:
 CHECKLIST (It is a table having a list of tasks to be done whenever an inspector goes for a site visit)

The table has three columns: Question, Answer, Remarks

Under Questions column, it shows a list of tasks for which the corresponding answers have to filled by the inspector before ending the site visit.

For Preventive Maintenance the Questions are (bracket contains what answer field is shown on the inspector tab):
Platform (Text)
S/W RIS (Text)
System Condition (Yes/No)
Hardware Condition (Yes/No)
Faulty (Yes/No)
Dust Clean (Yes/No)
System Cabling/MDF (Yes/No)
PEBX C.O. Lines (Yes/No)
Back-Up (Yes/No)
Cabinet (Yes/No)
UPS Batteries (Yes/No)
Power Supply (Yes/No)
Room Temp. (Yes/No)
SIP Trunks connection to other system (Yes/No)
System Image/Photo (Image upload)
Notes (Text for Remarks, multiple lines, paragraphs)
E1 (Yes/No)



For Service Maintenance the Questions are (bracket contains what answer field is shown on the inspector tab):

Platform/Equipment Type (Text)
Telephone Number (Field to type in Number)
Nature of Fault/Installation (Text multiple lines, remarks)
Action Taken (Text multiple lines, remarks)


*The (Yes/No) Questions have to be shown as a checkbox or something

10. Signatures: The inspector and the customer have to sign digitally

Then the engineer clicks submit and The Date Out Time is recorded (Submission only after both inspector and Customer has signed)
______________________________________________________________________



Customer sign add name of the employee from the customer who is signing (Customer is usually a company so at the end a field is there before digital signature to enter the name of customer employee, the inspector name can be automatically taken during login)



They need a software for the engineer interface

This should generate a pdf with a predefined template including the checklists and digital signatures in the admin end like a job card

Also, I need to create an admin panel where they can see all data including the last site visit, search tasks

_______________________________________________________________________

The application:


I prefer to create a next js application for this


We need an engineer interface and an admin interface
Both has login with ID and password

In the Engineer Interface, initially the engineer can login
then their name is shown (a welcome message)
Then the job card number (increment from last job card number) is displayed on top left
Then Date In field they can set the date and time, also give a button (Set To Now) to automatically set timestamp as that time when they click it.
All time is Kuwait Time
Then all the text fields one below the other
Date Out and Total Hours should be set at last I think I am not sure
Then a dropdown to select type
Inspector name (By default show the name of engineer who has logged in, they can change if needed) 
Then the tasks yes/no should be a toggle or something 

If they select Type as Service Maintenance, just show the fields for service maintenance

Also, if the admin wants to add more task fields for a particular type, that option is also needed






First just tell me the tables that i have to create in the database, the fields and the type
The entire schema in supabase
